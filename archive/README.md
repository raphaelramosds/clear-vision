# clear vision archive

Clear Vision was started written in Python to quickly prototype and test ideas. However, for performance reasons on video processing, the final implementation will be done in C++.

Therefore, this directory contains the archived Python code for Clear Vision. The code here is no longer maintained or updated, but it may still be useful for reference or historical purposes.
